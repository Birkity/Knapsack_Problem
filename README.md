### 🛍️ Knapsack Problem Solver Using EDA 🧠

A Python implementation of the **Knapsack Problem** using the **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)**. Optimize the selection of items to maximize value without exceeding the weight limit

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem** with customizable inputs.
- 📚 **EDA-Based Optimization:** Iteratively learns and improves solutions.
- 🛠️ **Modular Design:** Easy-to-follow code structure for educational purposes.
- 🖥️ **Real-Time Tracking:** See generation-by-generation progress in the console.
- ✅ **Final Output:** Displays the best solution and its total value.

## 📂 File Structure
- `main.py`: Main script containing the implementation.
- **No dependencies!** Runs on Python's standard library.

---

## 🛠️ Customization
- 🏋️ **Weights and Values:** Adjust item weights and values in the `weights` and `values` arrays.
- 🎯 **Weight Limit:** Set the `weight_limit` to define the knapsack's capacity.
- ⚙️ **EDA Parameters:** Tweak `population_size`, `generations`, and `top_k` for better results.
